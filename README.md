# Tanto
Norns Sample Slicer


The idea behind Tanto is to take a sample and cut it up.  I drew influence from the Monome Softcut Studies and Justmat's Sam Sampler for this project.  I also took some inspriation from the 1010 Bitbox.  The hands-on aspect of the Bitbox appeals to me as a performer, and I wanted to bring a little of that to the Norns.  
Import a sample into Tanto and move the start and end points to create new segments from that sample, and save that sample for later.  Control the rate of the sample, and the pre and rec level to create a nice crossfade.  

Functions to add include Crow integration as well as MIDI control.  

Maybe Grid control, we'll see what I can come up with.
